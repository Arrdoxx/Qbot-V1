# QBOT V1 ü§ñ

### What is this project ? üéà

This project is my first Discord bot with NODEJS technology. It is in version 12 of discord which makes it a bit obsolete. I used this bot for a long time for my old Discord server: The Spot.
I am currently working on the 2nd version of this discord bot.

### How did I create this project ? üé®

For this project, I went through quite a bit of YouTube tutorial and I used the documentation for some functionality.

### New knowledge thanks to this project ? üìì

I learned NODEJS technology and version 12 of discord.js.

### What can we improve in this project ? üßß

We can improve in this project: The security of the bot, The functionality, The anti-RAID, etc.
I also think of making a system of economy with the activity of the members. All of this will be implemented in the next version of QBot.
